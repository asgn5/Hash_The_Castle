# Hash_The_Castle
Simulation of a multiplayer game.

###### NOTE: We will merge to this branch when we collectively agree on changes
######         and/or when we have code free from grimy bugs.

##### Base logic
###### Includes a fully functional hashtable based on the specification.

###### TODO
1. Review design strategy
   1. settle on the UML & class structure for the base
2. fix any bugs.
3. move on to larger structure.
   1. ie. More complex logic as well as GUI.
